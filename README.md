## Task 1:  Calculate Factorial Using a Function
- Here, I create a function  using recursion
-  First in the code, there is a  variable num where the user will put the value.
-  Then a function is created as a factorial where the parameter is given.
-  than calling the function factorial by putting the num value as a parameter.

## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
-In this program, I first import the math module.
-Then, take the value from the user.
-Then uses log, sqrt and sine functions and prints their value.
